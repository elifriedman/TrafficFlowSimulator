#w: the weights for the TRPF. Weights are stored in the format t1:v1,t2:v2,...
#   where t1 is a threshold above the System Optimum and v1 is the actual weight.
#   in other words, "30:2" means that if there are more than 30 drivers above the 
#   System Optimum for a route, than the drivers on that route could report a
#   congestion level of 2
w = 10:3, 20:5, 50:7

#p: 0<=p<=1 Fraction of agents using the TRPF
#           When an agent is initialized, it will "decide" whether to use the 
#           TRPF by choosing a random number from 0 to 1 and seeing if it's 
#           less than p. If it is, it will use the TRPF. If not, it won't.
p = 1.0

#T: Number of previous rounds to use for calculating the TRPF
#   The TRPF = sum_over_weights(weight*num_agents_reported_that_weight)/num_agents_reporting
#            = sum_over_agents(weight_this_agent_reported)/num_agents_reporting
